                </blockquote>        
              
<p>A while back, my life went through a few pretty big changes in a short period of time; new husband, new country, new career… come to think of it, new life! One of the things I learned along the way was stepping outside of my comfort zone often resulted in positive things happening.</p>

<div class="highlightBox" id="webdev">
<p>I fell into web developing completely by accident and must concede that as far as career choices go, being a web developer wasn’t even in my top 100. I used to work in office administration which was a career I had followed since I finished my Bachelor’s degree. When I moved to the UK, I had an opportunity to rethink my career path and I was energised by the thought of doing something new and fulfilling, that would give me a sense of pride and achievement.</p> 
</div>

<p>I have always been interested in visual aspects of the web and had great admiration for people who could create amazing looking images. At the time, I had a very limited understanding of web-related careers, so I decided to start with studying web design.</p>
<p>During the first couple of months of my studying, I found that image editing or graphic design using Adobe Photoshop wasn’t providing the level of fulfilment I expected, so I moved on to the next module in the course, which was HTML.

<div class="highlightRound" id="coding">
<p>Coding was something completely new and foreign to me and in truth, I felt a bit lost for the first month. My patience was tested constantly and I don’t mind admitting that I shed a few tears in frustration when I was on the brink of giving up. I made a conscious decision to remain determined and I continued reassuring myself that the journey was worth the effort.</p>
</div>

<p>I started to tap into a wide range of resources, to assist with my learning; YouTube, Stack Overflow (which I find very useful whenever I get stuck!), books, online courses, classroom training and events. One event in particular gave me a broader understanding of web development was Designers/Developers Fiesta hosted in London. It provided the opportunity get introduced to the sort of work designers and developers do, as well as get insight into the wider industry, and to be with people who share the same interest as me was one of the highlights of the event. After that, I was hooked and I needed to quench my thirst for more web development knowledge.</p>

                <h2>Online Web Course</h2>
            </div>
              <img src="images/onlinecourse.jpg" class="images" alt="visual of e-Careers web courses">
          
              <div class="content" id="online">    
<p>During the early days of my new ventures into web development, I had very little idea about what direction I wanted to take, or even what options were available to me, so I loathe investing a lot of time and money on courses, as I didn’t want to risk losing interest, or realise that it was too difficult. I opted to pay a small fee to sign up for an online web design course with a company called <a href="http://www.e-careers.com/" target="_blank">e-Careers</a>, which covered the main aspects of web design and development, which are outlined below:</p>
<img src="images/course_outline.jpg" alt="visual of e-Careers web course outline">

<div class="highlightBox" id="ecareers">
<p>Being a complete rookie to not only web development, but also to the web industry in general, I struggled to understand some of the jargon and terminology that was used, which made learning difficult. I spent vast amounts of time doing additional research, in an effort to try and understand what I was being taught. Part of the challenge doing online courses, is that you can’t just raise your hand and get the answer, but on the upside, I learned to be resourceful and the research helped to cement what I was learning.</p>
</div>

<p><a href="http://www.e-careers.com/" target="_blank">e-Careers</a> provided a module-based package, which was very interactive. Virtual trainers talk you through the content of each module and regular tests help to verify how well your learning is going. I started by learning how to use Adobe Photoshop. I was introduced to the interface and some of the basic, more commonly-used features. I also got a really good handle on how much time and effort goes into enhancing and editing an image.</p>
<img src="images/photoshop_outline.jpg" id="outline" alt="visual of e-Careers Photoshop course outline">

<p>I then turned my attention to HTML and CSS. This is where things got a bit challenging! At first glance, any sort of computer-related coding looks incredibly complicated and it is something I’d never been exposed to. I struggled to grasp some of the concepts and didn’t really know the best way to learn codes, tags, layouts, etc. So I expanded my resources and bought a few books in order for me to understand coding better.</p>
<img src="images/books.jpg" id="books" alt="visual of HTML, CSS and Photoshop books">

<p>I had to exercise a LOT of patience and determination and over a period of a couple of months, things started to make sense. I found I could code basic web pages from a blank canvas, which was an incredibly rewarding experience!</p>
<p>I wanted to explore other ways of creating web pages, so I moved on to the Adobe Dreamweaver module. I learnt that it was possible to create a web page without knowing anything about web coding, which at first seemed very appealing, but after a while I found that I could do things quicker by manually coding.</p>
<p>To complement my web education, I also signed up at <a href="http://www.codecademy.com/" target="_blank">Code Academy</a>, which is a free online training resource for web developers. The available modules are below:</p>
<img src="images/codeacademy_outline.jpg" id="outline" alt="visual of Code Academy modules">

<p>The content was really easy to understand and the modules were simple to follow, which I found particularly useful when studying JavaScript. I could also track my progress online; as well as take tests challenge my knowledge. If I struggled to grasp something, I could pose my question(s) to its support community, who were generally pretty quick to answer! <a href="http://www.codecademy.com/" target="_blank">Code Academy</a> also allows the creation of groups, which allows people studying similar modules to get together and collaborate.</p>
<p>I had now gained a reasonable handle on what it took to be a <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/help/insideguardian/2009/sep/28/blogpost" target="_blank">(front-end)</a> web developer, as well as the potential career paths available to me. I was eager to accelerate my learning, so I decided it was time to invest a bit more in my education. I signed up for a classroom-based course with <a href="http://www.academyclass.com/" target="_blank">Academy Class</a>.</p>

        <div class="section" id="academyclass">
            <div class="navBox">
                <h2>Academy Class</h2>
            </div>    
              <img src="images/academyclass.jpg" class="images" alt="visual of Academy Class classroom">
          
              <div class="content" id="academy">    
<p>I was first introduced to Academy Class when I attended a Designers / Developers Fiesta in September 2012 in London hosted by them. I listened to guest speakers and their in-house trainers talking about different aspects of the web industry.</p>
<a href="https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/event/3619927300?utm_source=eb_email&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=new_attendee&utm_term=event_name" class="designersFiesta" target="_blank"><img src="images/fiesta.jpg" class="designersFiesta"></a>

<p>I had a chat with one of their sales people, as I was eager to get enrolled in a classroom-based web developer’s course, to assist with accelerating my learning. I was relieved that he didn’t deliver a hard-sell and took his time explaining the different course options. He even introduced me to one of the trainers, who also talked me through a few course options. I was impressed with their flexible approach and the reasonable prices were also a great lure! I was also given confidence that they were credible, as they as an authorized training partner for Adobe and Autodesk. The facilities are modern and easy to commute to (a short walk from London Waterloo station). They also provide a choice between Mac and PC.</p>
<p>Academy Class offered many of the modules I was interested in, which are conveniently split into different proficiency levels, so I took the plunge and enrolled!</p>
<p>I opted for the <a href="http://academyclass.com/save-with-creative-licence#programmer_content" target="_blank">“Become a Web Programmer”</a> training package (see below). This is where Academy Class’ flexibility really came into play that they let me tailor the course to suit my needs.</p>

<p>I’ve not yet completed PHP/MySQL, but my classes will be booked this August 2013. I’ll keep you posted on how I get on… Wish me luck, as it’s my first step into back-end development! Exciting times ahead! Woohoo!!!</p>
