              <div class="content" id="healthy">    
<p>Let me give you a preview of how I got into fitness…</p>
<p>When I was younger, like a lot of young women, I had a few body issues; my legs were too thin, my hips weren’t curvy enough, my boobs were too small and I’m sure there were a few others… cliché anybody?</p>

<div class="highlightRound" id="highlightHealthy">
<p>I figured the solution was to gain weight, which in my mind meant consume more! My ideal weight target was 100 pounds (7.14 stones or 45.36 kilograms) and at the time I was about 87 pounds (6.21 stones or 39.46 kilograms).</p> 
</div>

<p>I adopted a few different techniques; I ate larger portions, I ate just before bed, I was a regular at fast food establishments and being from the Philippines, I ate more rice. But I remained thin!</p>
<p>I invested in a <a href="http://www.herbalife.com/" target="_blank">weight management program</a> and added these to my existing “diet.” The needle on the scale started to move in the right direction and I eventually hit my 100-pound goal, unfortunately I couldn’t afford to keep investing in the products, so I had to drop them from my eating regime. My eating habits remained the same and I was surprised that I didn’t lose the weight. It was also at about this time (mid-20s) that I noticed my body was starting to change; my waist and hips were losing their firmness and my upper arms were getting a bit flabby.</p>
<p>What a dilemma, I wanted to maintain my weight, but I also wanted to tone up and shape the parts of my body that had suddenly developed a mind of their own! More on this later…</p>
<p>I moved to the United Kingdom in 2010 and set about trying to find a job; no mean feat in the middle of a recession. I spent a great deal of time sat in front of a computer scouring the web for jobs and attending the odd interview. Other than that, I had a lot of alone time during the day. I needed a change of scenery; something to take my mind off job hunting. I pulled on a pair of trainers and decided to go for a jog… which turned out to be more of a walk with a LOT of heavy breathing! </p>

<p>At about the same time, the Wimbledon tennis tournament had just kicked-off and since my husband and I were living in Wimbledon at the time, we figured why not get into the spirit of things and got knock a few balls about. Over the course of the next couple of months, we were regulars at the local courts and thankfully I picked it up pretty quickly.</p>
<p>I noticed that jogging became easier too; I guess if you chase enough balls, you’re bound to get fitter. I also used visualisation when jogging got tough; I pretended I was chasing down a tennis ball, which seemed to help me out. I started to set myself simple jogging goals; my very first one was to run 3km without stopping or walking. I remember when I achieved it, I was so excited that I called my husband at work and unloaded on him!</p>

<div class="highlightBox">
<p>I realised that fitness wasn’t a switch that could just be turned on; it needed PATIENCE, DETERMINATION and MOTIVATION. I applied myself and during the summer that followed, I started to get results I didn’t know were possible; my weight remained steady and my body started to take shape.</p>
</div>
              </div>               
    </div> 
      
    <div class="section" id="running">    
        <div class="navBox">
            <h2>Running</h2>
        </div>
              <img src="images/running1.jpg" class="images" alt="visual of website owner at the Race for Life">
          
              <div class="content" id="run">    
<p>I need to be upfront and tell you that up until my late 20s, I was not a runner, or a sportswoman of ANY type. My idea of being sporty was shooting a few frames of pool in the local pool hall.</p>

<div class="highlightRound" id="highlightRunning">
<p>As far as I was concerned, exercise of any sort was effort that I would rather not exert. I will be honest and say that had I found a job shortly after I arrived in the United Kingdom, it is very likely that I would never have discovered the joy of running, or exercise in general for that matter. I guess some things do happen for a reason.</p>
</div>

<p>I wish I could tell you that I took to running like a duck to water, but that would be a straight-face lie! It was tough at first, but I decided to stick with it. The first ever running goal I set myself was to complete 3km without stopping, which turned out to be harder than it sounded. I hit the road up to 2 - 3 times a week, sometimes getting frustrated that my body wouldn’t do what I wanted it to do, but within a few weeks, I managed a complete 3km route without needing to stop  and walk and catch my breath! ELATION! My first ever fitness goal had been achieved and I wanted MORE!</p>

<div class="highlightBox">
<p>I started to focus on running against the clock and in particular, chasing down my previous best times; and I found it to be incredibly liberating to compete against myself.</p>
</div>

<p>That motivation kept me active for a few months, but my body was crying out to be worked for longer, so I set my sights on running further. I pushed my distance target out to 5km and followed the same process of continual improvement.</p>
<p>Once I was comfortable with the distance, I decided it was time to enter a race. I entered a 5km Race For Life, which generated feelings of excitement and nervousness. I had never run a race before and didn’t know what to expect, but I set my sights on getting round without stopping. Race day was a sunny affair in Guildford Park. I set off feeling confident and the nerves soon subsided. Once I got through the crowds, I hit my stride and had to concentrate on slowing my pace. I guess the excitement and adrenalin were trying hard to spur me forward! I crossed the finish line in just on 30 minutes, which was a personal best. What a great feeling!!</p>
<p>Getting in running wasn’t all plain sailing for me; I had a few challenges to overcome. I suffer from severe shin splints, which weren’t helped by the cheap trainers I started out with. Running in winter was always a pain; I struggled with breathing in the cold air and I also suffered from a fair amount of muscle pain when I first started. A tip for those of you just starting out; if your legs are aching after a run, pour yourself an ice bath and soak in it for about 15 minutes!!! It sounds like crazy talk, but it’ll wipe out the muscle pain. </p>
<p>To help keep my body lean and toned, I also workout at home and at the gym. The challenges have been worth the pay-off. It’s the starting off that the hardest part, but focus on the results.</p>

              <div class="content" id="workOut">    
<p>I started working out to assist me with my running and to stay lean and toned. I split my workouts between going to the gym and following the <a href="http://www.nike.com/us/en_us/c/training/nike-plus-kinect-training?ref=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.co.uk%2Furl%3Fsa%3Dt%26rct%3Dj%26q%3Dnike%252B%2520kinect%2520training%26source%3Dweb%26cd%3D1%26cad%3Drja%26ved%3D0CE4QFjAA%26url%3Dhttp%253A%252F%252Fwww.nike.com%252Fus%252Fen_gb%252Fc%252Ftraining%252Fnike-plus-kinect-training%26ei%3DZ9mxUaySLYmW0QWU7ICAAw%26usg%3DAFQjCNFTTkMUP6aMAC-aZ-0oG9OyhN_kVg%26bvm%3Dbv.47534661%2Cd.d2k" target="_blank">Nike+ Kinect Training</a> for Xbox workout program. I must confess that at first I was very sceptical about the latter, as I couldn’t see how it was different from just following a workout DVD (which I loathe).</p>
<p>I love the fact that the Nike+ Kinect Training program is fully interactive. It tracks your every movement and the virtual trainer lets you know when your form isn’t correct. You have three options to choose from: Get Lean, Get Strong or Get Toned. The exercises are also customized to my body type and goals and the workouts alternate between strength and cardio training. Programs run on four-week cycles and at the end of each cycle, you are put through a fitness test to track your progress. I usually do 1 - 2 Nike+ Kinect workouts a week.</p>

<p>My gym workouts focus on two main goals; I want to be able to do 10 <em>PROPER</em> press-ups and 10 pull-ups, completely unassisted, though I also throw in a leg work out from time-to-time. I usually only go to the gym once a week.
To build up my push-up power, I work out my chest and triceps. An example of my push-up workout is below. I cycle in other exercises regularly, just to keep my muscles guessing.</p>

<p>I make a point of taking a week long break from exercise every 8 weeks or so, just to give my body a chance to fully recover and recharge. I also make sure that my diet reflects my exercise regime! Nutrition plays a key part in making sure I have enough energy to get me through the day and to help me keep my body looking the way I want it to look. </p>

              <div class="content" id="eating">    
<div class="highlightBox" id="highlightEating">
<p>I don’t diet, I eat <a href="food.html">healthy!</a> I’ve made a conscious lifestyle choice to eat food that isn’t going to “harm” my body, but is not to say that I deprive myself, or totally ban junk food from my life. My life is about finding a balance and working out regularly means I’m constantly burning calories, so the odd pizza or ice cream isn’t going to be the end of the world.</p>
</div>

<p>I’m not a nutritionist, or dietician; in fact, I’ve only recently started learning about different types of carbohydrates and calories. Who knew that you get “good” and “bad” calories? Not sure what I mean by that, here’s a really basic overview. You’re looking for a quick snack, something in the region of 100 calories. Consider a bag of chocolate buttons; the calories contain little-to-no nutritional value and once your insulin levels have spiked and you’ve come down from your sugar rush, you’ll soon be hungry again and your body would’ve stored those calories as fat, rather than tried to burn them off. Now, consider a bag of almonds; full of nutrients, fibre and other goodness. Your body will digest those calories more efficiently and you’ll stay fuller for longer, you’ll also get fewer cravings! </p>
<p>At this juncture I should also let you know that I don’t count calories! I eat decent portions of tasty, <a href="food.html">healthy foods</a> and I have a small glass of red wine with dinner most nights. When I was trying to change my body shape, I was under the illusion that if I just changed what I ate, I’d get the results I wanted; it took me a few years to learn that eating is only half of the equation. Good food needs to be paired with some form of exercise to get great results. I don’t get too scientific about it; on running days, I eat foods higher in complex carbohydrates e.g. oats, brown pasta. On workout days, I up my protein intake e.g. chicken, eggs, fish. Eating well doesn’t mean sacrificing good tasting meals! Here are a few of my <a href="food.html">favourites!</a></p>

<div class="highlightRound" id="highlight">
<p>It’s also worth mentioning that I don’t pay any attention to how much I weigh, after all weight is just a number. What is important for me is how I look when I look in the mirror and how I feel about myself. My main goal is to be strong, fit and healthy, and not to have a Victoria Secret Angel-like body. (Although having a nice body is definitely a bonus!) This is my lifestyle. This is a choice. And I choose to be healthy. :)</p>
